        <p>School is already resuming and the holiday just started!!!! And the holiday wasn't even THAT long!!! Like... Haddassah's new school is resuming MAY 6TH!!!! </p>

        <p>Anyways.... here are some tips that will help you be up and ready for the new term!!! (My personal ways.)
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Get a jotter
            </li>
            <li>
                Have a new term resolution
            </li>
            <li>
                Eradicate all distractions
            </li>
            <li>
                Have it in mind to make your parents proud
            </li>
            <li>
                Always believe in yourself
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't let others put you down
            </li>
            <li>
                Get a goal and work towards it
            </li>
            <li>
                Never let anyone intimidate you (Have it in mind that if anything or anyone is disturbing you, your parents are there for you. You can vent your frustations to them, or any of your problems. I recommend this because it always always works for me.ðŸ¥° )
            </li>
